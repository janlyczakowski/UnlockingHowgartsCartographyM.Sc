# Unlocking Hogwarts: A Case Study on School Accessibility

This project, created for a Cartography M.Sc. course ("Mapping Project") is a visual case study on school accessibility. It's a web map application built with **React** and **Three.js**. It demonstrates how school facilities can be transformed to become more accessible for people with mobility disability. Hogwarts, from the book series Harry Potter, serves as a case study school of interest.
